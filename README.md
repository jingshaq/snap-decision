# snap-decision
A program to classify images into keep or delete.

This program is meant to help review 1000s of images taken during a day of wildlife photography to remove poor quality or redundant images. It will also help identify camera settings that result in good or poor images. 

This project started as an exploration in using ChatGPT as a coding assistant as I reimplemented an old image reviewing project.
